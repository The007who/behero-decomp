# Behero Decompilation
The Behero is an Italian toy released in 2010 by Giochi Preziosi. 

This is an effort in extracting the game data from it and hopefully reverse engineer for preservation and cross play. This branch is only for the decompilation process, there is a separate branch for the Wiki.

I will try to document as much as possible on the [Wiki](https://the007who.github.io/behero-decomp/).
